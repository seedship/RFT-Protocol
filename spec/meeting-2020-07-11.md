# Meeting 2020-07-11
This only includes issues and misunderstanding which have an impact on the actual protocol execution and thereby also affect the implementations.

Issues that only deal with things like wording of the spec are not yet included (see open issues for that).

Aug 1st: Both groups should have their implementation in a state where we can test interop'erability.

## Agenda
1. Support of [multiple servers](https://gitlab.lrz.de/ge36xuy/xxx-protocol-design/-/issues/4#note_766671)
2. Should the RFC specify the behaviour if the first request message is lost? [gitlab comment](https://gitlab.lrz.de/ge36xuy/xxx-protocol-design/-/issues/8#note_763191)
3. Support of multiple downloads simultaneously: The base protocol supported multiple files to be downloaded simultaneously. We then changed that to only one file for the sake of simplicity. After that Mathis has brought it back up. This has big implications on the implementations and also on the ACK 8mor on that in 4.). [gitlab issue](https://gitlab.lrz.de/ge36xuy/xxx-protocol-design/-/issues/4)
4. ACK Layout: Depending on 3., the ACK Layout can/must be adjusted: If multiple files are supported: Should we do 1 file-ack/message or multiple? Also how should it be handled, if the last packet got lost? See [#7](https://gitlab.lrz.de/ge36xuy/xxx-protocol-design/-/issues/7) for more infos.
5. Serverside RTT Calculation: Mathis critized that the current method (meassure the time and maybe take averages) might be inaccurate ([gitlab comment](https://gitlab.lrz.de/ge36xuy/xxx-protocol-design/-/issues/4#note_766373)). Do we want to specify this feature? And if so, what would be the best way? [gitlab issue](https://gitlab.lrz.de/ge36xuy/xxx-protocol-design/-/issues/10)
6. When should metadata be sent?
7. Issue 12: [Transmission speed: Messages/s instead of chunk/s](https://gitlab.lrz.de/ge36xuy/xxx-protocol-design/-/issues/12).
8. What to do when client's file offset doesn't increase
9. Security Considerations: If you can think of any possible security issues/mitigations, please add them to [#11](https://gitlab.lrz.de/ge36xuy/xxx-protocol-design/-/issues/11)

## Protocol
1. No multiple servers
2. Client should stop listening on port and send same request again using a new port. After what time should client retry? Suggestion (use MAY or SHOULD): increasing timeout, e.g., exponential backoff (1 second, then 2 seconds, then 4 seconds).
3. Check section below: "Consensus for 3/4"
4. Check section below: "Consensus for 3/4"
5. Keep it, try it out with the implemenations and see how accurate they are
6. Check section below: "When should metadata be sent?"
7. Transmission speed: use messages/s
8. See section below

## Consensus for 3/4: ACK format and sending order
The server MUST send the files in the order that they were listed in the initial client request message. The server MAY start sending parts of, e.g., file 2 before it has received an ACK that all chunks of file 1 have been received. ACK message format: `Filenumber: 2, Offset = 8, ResendEntries (file, offset, length) = [(1, 3, 2)]`.

                    [(3, 0, -1), (4, 0, -1)]

ACK message:

FileNumber: 5, Offset: 8,
MissingMetadata: []
ResendEntries [(file, offset, length)] = [(4, 6, 1), (5, 3, 2), (5, 7, 1)]


--- Metadata of file 4 missing (scenario 1)
Chunks of file no 4: |__0__|__1__|...?
                     |---rcvd----|

                      _____________________________________________________________________________
Chunks of file no 5: |__0__|__1__|__2__|__3__|__4__|__5__|__6__|__7__|__8__|__9__|__10_|__11_|__12_|
                     |----- received --|           |--received-|     |recv-|

FileNumber: 5, Offset: 8,
MissingMetadataOfLastFile: true (in ACK)
ResendEntries [(file, offset, length)] = [(4, 2, 0), (5, 3, 2), (5, 7, 1)]

Resending metadata: The server "must" resend metadata. It figures out what to resend from two sources.
1. The server finds each resend entry where length=0. It SHOULD resend the metadata for the file in that resend entry. The server MAY decide against resending the metadata if it has already resent the metadata within the last RTT. (Because of RTT/4)
2. Each ACK has a flag "Missing Metadata". If that flag is set, the server SHOULD resend the metadata for the file that is indicated by the "global" file number. The server MAY decide against resending the metadata if it has already resent the metadata within the last RTT. (Because of RTT/4)


--- Metadata of file 4 missing (scenario 2)
Chunks of file no 4: |__0__|__1__|__2__|__3__|...?
                     |---rcvd----|     |rcvd-|...

                      _____________________________________________________________________________
Chunks of file no 5: |__0__|__1__|__2__|__3__|__4__|__5__|__6__|__7__|__8__|__9__|__10_|__11_|__12_|
                     |----- received --|           |--received-|     |recv-|

FileNumber: 5, Offset: 8,
MissingMetadataOfLastFile: true (in ACK)
ResendEntries [(file, offset, length)] = [(4, 2, 1), (4, 4, 0), (5, 3, 2), (5, 7, 1)]
```

## When should metadata be sent?
1. The server MAY send the metadata of file A before any data packet of file A. The benefits of this is that it is easier for the client to know when a transmission is finished and write the file off to disk.
2. The server MAY wait for the entire transmission to finish. The benefit of this is the calculation of the checksum might be more efficient.
3. The server MUST send the metadata of file A at some point in time during, before or right after the "transmission of the file A".
4. The server MUST send the metadata of file A at some point during the connection.
5. It is RECOMMENDED that the server sends the metadata of file A before the transmission of file A is finished. 

Consensus: use option 4.

## What to do when client's file offset doesn't increase?
Issue: the server sends data but the client does not receive any of it. The client would send ACKs with filenumber=0, offset=0, and resendentries=[]. The server would continue sending data and even increase the sending rate.

Solution proposal: If the client does not receive any data chunks for **6 * RTT** (or the timeout we specify later), the client should send a close connection message and reopen the connection on another port.
```
                      _____________________________________________________________________________
Chunks of file no 5: |__0__|__1__|__2__|__3__|__4__|__5__|__6__|__7__|__8__|__9__|__10_|__11_|__12_|
                     |----- received --|           |--received-|     |recv-|

Would result in the following ACK message:
Filenumber: 5, Offset = 8, ResendEntries (offset, lenght) = [(3, 2), (7,1)]
```
